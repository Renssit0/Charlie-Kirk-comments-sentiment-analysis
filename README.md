# Charlie Kirk sentiment analysis

## Objective

Charlie Kirks' assasination has brought a lot of media attention from both supporters and critics, and as the political globe takes a look back at his legacy, some sour comments are bound to appear. As his figure has always been a controversial one, this might not be all too new, however bringing an end to a life is unjustifiable even for many of the most tenacious critics. Perhaps in this time for mourning, he won't be so viciously critiqued. Or perhaps the comments of the furthest extreme of the opposition will bring even more hate to the conversation. 

This project aims to uncover the answers to these questions by contrasting reddit comments before and after his death.
