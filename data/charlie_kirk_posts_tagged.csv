10,"What can democrats do to be more effective in today’s media environment? | One of the primary proposed causes of Harris’ loss this election was due to the current media environment. People have claimed that social media tends to favor conservative talking points and more effectively opens the door for conservative conspiracies. Republican talking points get proliferated with far more ease than Democrat ones. Reasons for this are various. Algorithms tend to favor more extreme rhetoric. Conservatives have a large influencer base like LibsofTikTok and Charlie Kirk. Joe Rogan was recently spiraled further and further right. Six of the top ten news podcasts are right wing, while there’s only one, maybe two, that could be considered left wing. Elon musk has purchased Twitter to make it a pro-conservative outlet. Traditional media institutions, including high have leaned left, like cable, newspapers, and local tv, have all been in sharp decline. Republicans have much more and modern media companies that are more deliberately conservative than democrats. What can democrats do to compete with the current modern media environment that heavily favors republicans? Do they need less purity tests?

26,"JD Vance gave a glowing endorsement to a Neo-Nazi book that advocates for killing people on the left, including family members | So JD Vance, Donald Trump JR, Tucker Carlson and even Peter Boghossian endorsed a book called ""Unhumans"" written by Jack Posobeic and my god is it disturbing. For the uninitiated Jack Posobeic is a Neo-Nazi sidekick of Steve Bannon and a cohost of Charlie Kirk who has recently been calling for ""Open Season on RINOs"" labeling them an invasive species. He has been invited to Ukraine recently by the treasury secretary as a part of the press corps and to a trip across Europe by Pete Hegseth. He was a part of the PR event where influencers were given pieces of the Epstein files. He has been seen in photos with Trump and at various events like Mar-a-lago parties and at the inauguration ball. With Mike Tyson/Jake Paul **Anyways, to the book**. Here are some excerpts: Note: Unhumans = secret Cultural Marxists that encompasses a wide range of normal Democrats based on the description he gives >You may already be a subject of unhumans. You are employed by unhumans. You are married to . . . you get it. You know. There’s nowhere for you to run or to hide. You are at the mercy of those who show no mercy. We will not fault you for doing what you must to survive… >Pinochet offered reciprocal punishment to the communist revolutionaries, demoralizing their cause and diminishing their ranks. All allies of anti-civilization were ruthlessly excised from Chilean society. The story of tossing communists out of helicopters hails from Pinochet’s elimination of communism during the mid to late 1970s. Wherever Pinochet was, there was no communism. And the globalist intelligentsia didn’t like that. Not one little bit. **JD Vance's endorsement:** >In the past, communists marched in the streets waving red flags. Today, they march through HR [Human Resources], college campuses, and courtrooms to wage lawfare against good, honest people. In Unhumans, Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec reveal their plans and show us what to do to fight back Steve Bannon's endorsement (he wrote the foreword) >“Study this book. Share this book.” A paranoid screed about Unhumans: >Unhumans still support communism after it killed 100 million people in the twentieth century. They are not bothered that communism killed 100 million people. In fact, they think 100 million deaths is just a good start. Those wholly possessed by resentment want to 10X that number. On a base level, unhumans seek the death of the successful and the desecration of the beautiful. They want to smash civilization. And so whenever and wherever they gain power, they do. And yet, conservatives would rather whine about equal treatment while unhumans are drawing them toward freshly dug graves. The ""Iron Law of Reciprocity"" the book champions: >To fight back, conservatives, centrists, moderates, and even good liberals will need to embrace something they have never considered. They must embrace exact reciprocity. That which is done by the communist and the regime must be done unto them. The book is essentially goading the reader into the idea that the threat is everywhere and you must act: >Something is deeply wrong with the way things are going and you know it. You may not be able to explain it with studies, surveys, or statistics, but you feel it. You’ve felt this way for a while. Like there’s some outside force or group or . . . something . . . that’s sent us all off course from the libertarian utopia we should’ve achieved by now. It doesn’t seem like one -ism or -ation is entirely to blame, like globalism or immigration, capitalism or inflation. … Evidence of the unhuman activity is everywhere we look. But can we really pin all those on communists? Nobody pays attention to CPUSA. And there hasn’t been a Carmelite nun–style massacre. Or mass arrest and torture of landlords. But they’re arresting landlords in New York City, now. And yet . . . the history of the revolution . . . the present day . . . it feels directionally accurate, doesn’t it? [idiosyncratic ellipses in original] >We don’t negotiate with globalist neo-Marxists. We don’t negotiate with the political version of an auto-immune disease. In a word, ladies and gentlemen—taken from the title of my book—we don’t negotiate with un-humans. Because that’s the stakes of this battle: humanity versus un-humanity. Populist nationalists versus atheist Marxist globalists. Strength, beauty, and genius versus weakness, ugliness, and stupidity. Civilization versus barbarism. Crime and chaos versus law and order… This was taken from Nathan J Robinson's article in currentaffairs. It's also where I got the book excerpts from >They say that they “believe in beauty, truth, law, and order.” Tolerance and freedom of expression are absent from that list. They are very explicit in saying that democracy is not a priority, admiringly quoting Franco saying “we do not believe in government through the voting booth.” They comment that “Democracy has never worked to protect innocents from the unhumans. It is time to stop playing by rules they won’t.” The “great American counterrevolution to depose the Cultural Marxists” must be conducted “with the resolve of Franco and the thoroughness of McCarthy.” Beyond Franco, McCarthy, and Pinochet, their models include “Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Pyotr Wrangel, [and] Chiang Kai-shek.” These men were not squeamish about using violence, or terribly concerned with popular legitimacy. >Reasoned discourse itself must be jettisoned. We do not “reason with unreasonables,” Posobiec and Lisec say. Humility is weakness. “Never apologize,” they say. **Other Book Endorsements** >“Jack Posobiec sees the big picture and isn’t afraid to describe it. He’s been punished for that, but it makes him one of the rare people worth listening to.” —Tucker Carlson >“The far Left murdered 100 million people in the twentieth century and have repeatedly shown that they will stop at nothing to achieve their totalitarian goals. They have torn down countless societies using a sophisticated playbook of propaganda. The only way to stop them in the future is to use their own subversive playbook against them. Unhumans reveals that playbook and teaches us how to deploy it immediately to save the West.” —Donald Trump, Jr. >“With beauty, rhythm, and prose more often seen in fiction, Unhumans is a breakneck adventure through millennia of human history. Posobiec and Lisec guide the reader through Ancient Rome, Maoist China, Franco’s Spain, and more as they chronicle the awesome and ancient battle between civilization and uncivilization, humans and unhumans. Placing the current culture war in historical perspective, Unhumans teaches readers to combat the tyrannical forces that have crumbled empires—and that have come for our own."" —Dr. Peter Boghossian I could write about Jack Posobeic himself for a while, there is a never-ending rabbit-hole of sketchy shit this dude has done. He is probably working with the Russians    >Posobiec has referred to his Belarusian-born wife Tanya, mentioned in the above text, as a “linguist.” She boasted publicly about his participation in the #MacronLeaks campaign, and has also appeared to champion the Russian government on social media. >Posobiec promoted to his followers Dugin’s 1997 book, The Foundations of Geopolitics, a 600-page Russian-language tome that argues Russian security services should “introduce geopolitical disorder” in the United States by promoting sectarian and racial tensions. As SPLC’s Hatewatch previously reported, Posobiec tweeted about The Foundations of Geopolitics seven times in just under an hour on April 23, 2017 Posobeic also was the guy who posted the workplace of Roy Moore's accuser (the one who was sexually abused as a 14 year old) He was also one of the main instigators around Pizzagate and many other Russian conspiracies.

43,"JD Vance gave a glowing endorsement to a Neo-Nazi book that advocates for killing people on the left, including family members | So JD Vance, Donald Trump JR, Tucker Carlson and even Peter Boghossian endorsed a book called ""Unhumans"" written by Jack Posobeic and my god is it disturbing. For the uninitiated Jack Posobeic is a Neo-Nazi sidekick of Steve Bannon and a cohost of Charlie Kirk who has recently been calling for ""Open Season on RINOs"" labeling them an invasive species. He has been invited to Ukraine recently by the treasury secretary as a part of the press corps and to a trip across Europe by Pete Hegseth. He was a part of the PR event where influencers were given pieces of the Epstein files. He has been seen in photos with Trump and at various events like Mar-a-lago parties and at the inauguration ball. With Mike Tyson/Jake Paul **Anyways, to the book**. Here are some excerpts: Note: Unhumans = secret Cultural Marxists that encompasses a wide range of normal Democrats based on the description he gives >You may already be a subject of unhumans. You are employed by unhumans. You are married to . . . you get it. You know. There’s nowhere for you to run or to hide. You are at the mercy of those who show no mercy. We will not fault you for doing what you must to survive… >Pinochet offered reciprocal punishment to the communist revolutionaries, demoralizing their cause and diminishing their ranks. All allies of anti-civilization were ruthlessly excised from Chilean society. The story of tossing communists out of helicopters hails from Pinochet’s elimination of communism during the mid to late 1970s. Wherever Pinochet was, there was no communism. And the globalist intelligentsia didn’t like that. Not one little bit. **JD Vance's endorsement:** >In the past, communists marched in the streets waving red flags. Today, they march through HR [Human Resources], college campuses, and courtrooms to wage lawfare against good, honest people. In Unhumans, Jack Posobiec and Joshua Lisec reveal their plans and show us what to do to fight back Steve Bannon's endorsement (he wrote the foreword) >“Study this book. Share this book.” A paranoid screed about Unhumans: >Unhumans still support communism after it killed 100 million people in the twentieth century. They are not bothered that communism killed 100 million people. In fact, they think 100 million deaths is just a good start. Those wholly possessed by resentment want to 10X that number. On a base level, unhumans seek the death of the successful and the desecration of the beautiful. They want to smash civilization. And so whenever and wherever they gain power, they do. And yet, conservatives would rather whine about equal treatment while unhumans are drawing them toward freshly dug graves. The ""Iron Law of Reciprocity"" the book champions: >To fight back, conservatives, centrists, moderates, and even good liberals will need to embrace something they have never considered. They must embrace exact reciprocity. That which is done by the communist and the regime must be done unto them. The book is essentially goading the reader into the idea that the threat is everywhere and you must act: >Something is deeply wrong with the way things are going and you know it. You may not be able to explain it with studies, surveys, or statistics, but you feel it. You’ve felt this way for a while. Like there’s some outside force or group or . . . something . . . that’s sent us all off course from the libertarian utopia we should’ve achieved by now. It doesn’t seem like one -ism or -ation is entirely to blame, like globalism or immigration, capitalism or inflation. … Evidence of the unhuman activity is everywhere we look. But can we really pin all those on communists? Nobody pays attention to CPUSA. And there hasn’t been a Carmelite nun–style massacre. Or mass arrest and torture of landlords. But they’re arresting landlords in New York City, now. And yet . . . the history of the revolution . . . the present day . . . it feels directionally accurate, doesn’t it? [idiosyncratic ellipses in original] >We don’t negotiate with globalist neo-Marxists. We don’t negotiate with the political version of an auto-immune disease. In a word, ladies and gentlemen—taken from the title of my book—we don’t negotiate with un-humans. Because that’s the stakes of this battle: humanity versus un-humanity. Populist nationalists versus atheist Marxist globalists. Strength, beauty, and genius versus weakness, ugliness, and stupidity. Civilization versus barbarism. Crime and chaos versus law and order… This was taken from Nathan J Robinson's article in currentaffairs. It's also where I got the book excerpts from >They say that they “believe in beauty, truth, law, and order.” Tolerance and freedom of expression are absent from that list. They are very explicit in saying that democracy is not a priority, admiringly quoting Franco saying “we do not believe in government through the voting booth.” They comment that “Democracy has never worked to protect innocents from the unhumans. It is time to stop playing by rules they won’t.” The “great American counterrevolution to depose the Cultural Marxists” must be conducted “with the resolve of Franco and the thoroughness of McCarthy.” Beyond Franco, McCarthy, and Pinochet, their models include “Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, Pyotr Wrangel, [and] Chiang Kai-shek.” These men were not squeamish about using violence, or terribly concerned with popular legitimacy. >Reasoned discourse itself must be jettisoned. We do not “reason with unreasonables,” Posobiec and Lisec say. Humility is weakness. “Never apologize,” they say. **Other Book Endorsements** >“Jack Posobiec sees the big picture and isn’t afraid to describe it. He’s been punished for that, but it makes him one of the rare people worth listening to.” —Tucker Carlson >“The far Left murdered 100 million people in the twentieth century and have repeatedly shown that they will stop at nothing to achieve their totalitarian goals. They have torn down countless societies using a sophisticated playbook of propaganda. The only way to stop them in the future is to use their own subversive playbook against them. Unhumans reveals that playbook and teaches us how to deploy it immediately to save the West.” —Donald Trump, Jr. >“With beauty, rhythm, and prose more often seen in fiction, Unhumans is a breakneck adventure through millennia of human history. Posobiec and Lisec guide the reader through Ancient Rome, Maoist China, Franco’s Spain, and more as they chronicle the awesome and ancient battle between civilization and uncivilization, humans and unhumans. Placing the current culture war in historical perspective, Unhumans teaches readers to combat the tyrannical forces that have crumbled empires—and that have come for our own."" —Dr. Peter Boghossian I could write about Jack Posobeic himself for a while, there is a never-ending rabbit-hole of sketchy shit this dude has done. He is probably working with the Russians    >Posobiec has referred to his Belarusian-born wife Tanya, mentioned in the above text, as a “linguist.” She boasted publicly about his participation in the #MacronLeaks campaign, and has also appeared to champion the Russian government on social media. >Posobiec promoted to his followers Dugin’s 1997 book, The Foundations of Geopolitics, a 600-page Russian-language tome that argues Russian security services should “introduce geopolitical disorder” in the United States by promoting sectarian and racial tensions. As SPLC’s Hatewatch previously reported, Posobiec tweeted about The Foundations of Geopolitics seven times in just under an hour on April 23, 2017 Posobeic also was the guy who posted the workplace of Roy Moore's accuser (the one who was sexually abused as a 14 year old) He was also one of the main instigators around Pizzagate and many other Russian conspiracies.

Gavin Newsom is doing something the different and I’ll admit I’ve been sleeping on it until this video. Some highlights are: 1) Admitting the mistakes of the election, how “the left” is seen in the media. 2) Admitting the absolute dominance Trump and Republicans have in communicating information and sending the message of not just their own views but also that of Democrats with no Democrats in the space to fight back. 3) What California has been doing for the past three months since Trump was elected. Did you know it’s the world’s fifth largest economy and #1 manufacturing state in America? 4) Newsom has a podcast can he’s talked to Charlie Kirk on it. He’s also debated other right wing pundits and is a good debater. He also acknowledges with humility that he isn’t the one platforming them, they are platforming him. 5) To win the next election the Democratic Party needs its members to leave their Ivory Towers and go into the spaces where their critics live.

60,"Watch out for the guys at the Charlie Kirk table, one of them got violent | Basically just the header, a spokesperson at the table got really violent and tried to fight me. Just a PSA, I don't want anyone getting hurt. **(Edited to remove identifying information about any of the individuals mentioned per moderator  If you don't know already, Charlie Kirk is this alt-right, Christian nationalist grifter who comes to college campuses and farms content ""debating"" college students. He has these clubs across campus called ""Turning Point USA,"" who have been recently advertising his soon arrival at SFSU. While walking through the other tables after getting free pizza, I ran into a person who had been talking to the table for about 20 minutes. I leaned into him and said ""Charlie Kirk directly told a black child that the Civil Rights movement was a mistake on camera. If that isn't enough for these guys, I don't think arguing with them will do any good."" There were 3 people at that table. Lets call them **Person A**, **Person B**, and **Person C**. **Person A** said something along the lines of ""I don't agree with that, that's not good."" **Person B** disregarded the comment completely and continued the table's outreach. **Person C** started getting really heated and stanced up, violently threatening me. I was already about 20-30 feet away, and honestly I was more embarrassed for him than anything else at first. He kept flexing and yelling things like ""do you see a difference between you and me?"" I'm not the biggest guy physically, but I am **not identifiably taller or shorter** than him, so I responded ""about a foot."" I am not too proud of this encounter. I should not have made an emasculating comment based on his stature **or lack of stature**, but I think that sent him over the edge. I walked away into the library for some Peet's coffee, which was my plan this whole time, and he soon followed me into the library. I'm not sure what his plan was, to fight me in the library or what, but we ended up both getting in line for coffee. I kind of side-eyed him to see what he was up to, and he was already staring at me and just fuming. I asked, ""are you the guy who was trying to fight me outside?"" (He had taken off his sunglasses and he was holding his hat, so I wanted to be sure I had the right person). All that did was rile him up further, and he started saying stuff like, ""little b\*\*\*\* I would have decked you if I wanted to p\*\*\*\* a\*\* b\*\*\*\*"" right in front of the baristas. I felt super awkward and embarrassed, I felt awful for the baristas who were put into that situation of having to sit there while some insecure man started threatening me, but most of all, I felt really bad for the guy. He went off, ate at a table alone, and just kept staring at me until he left. I don't know if this guy is a student, an employee of TPUSA, or what, but definitely watch out for him. He's a bit unstable, and I don't want anyone to actually get hurt if he ends up making more than empty threats. I ended up telling campus security soon after it happened, and all they said they could do was ""keep an eye on him."" Edit: **Person C**, if you're reading this, don't just try to fight anyone who calls out racist comments.

65,"Republican Party Rhetoric? | This growing race war and anti-black ideology within conservatism is pushing me further left than expected. At first, I disdained liberals and leftists for calling every Trump supporter racist because it devalues the word and rhetoric. I still don’t agree with this behavior whatsoever and loathe whoever does so. But, what is with more and more men being influenced under these hateful ideologies? You have Charlie Kirk preaching how systemic racism isn’t real and how we were better off before the Civil Rights Act. In addition to him making the assertion that Americans can’t trust Black employees due to DEI, despite white women being the biggest beneficiary which is disgusting. Then, Matt Walsh blew up for his claim on how Black men are disproportionately violent following the Karmelo Anthology stabbing. As a result, FBAs were offended and misled millions into believing it was in self defense. If anything this proved to me, regardless of race, the right has an unsettling rhetoric towards it and fueling division. Now you have young white men claiming how there’s a privilege to being Black because the family got a new car and house ( both of which were bought in 2023 so yet again disinformation .) This entire situation is messy because it had nothing to do with race but the right manipulated the narrative. Anyone who donated genuinely only believed it was out of this narrative he was jumped and bullied. Not solely because “ they wanted revenge on whites “. Finally, we have a woman receiving overwhelming support for calling an autistic child a n*gger as a rebuttal. Unfortunately, this radicalizes more Black Americans, as they witnessed white supremacists receive financial support repeatedly, yet now, when a young Black man is seemingly scrutinized for acting in self-defense, it’s considered wrong. It’s all just so gross to me- why can’t we acknowledge both class and race issues within America. Why can’t we all just listen to each other? I wanted to be a politician to genuinely help not only poor blacks but poor whites within the Appalachia region but if they’re gonna inherently think I’m violent is it even worth it? In all honesty, I want to still fight for the right, for actual conservatives, moderates and independents who felt forced into voting for Trump because Kamala was seen as worse. I want the Republican party to die off with this rhetoric for once. We have a center-right alternative guided by Thomas Massies or Rand Paul, and the Republican party can keep capitalizing off of culture wars.

According to him abortion is never morally permissible because all human lives, regardless of developmental stage or location, have rights and are entitled to life. But couldn’t this argument be countered with a thought experiment of a burning building where you can only save 5 human embryos or 1 toddler? Because if we were to follow Charlie Kirk’s argument, then the 5 human embryos would have to be saved since it’s better to save 5 lives over 1. However, most people in that scenario would probably go and save the 1 toddler, indicating developmental stage does play a role in personhood. Another counter could be triage at a hospital where a young adult and an elderly person come in with similar severe injuries, but more resources are directed to the young adult because it’s determined they have a better chance to live and recover than the elderly person.",NEGATIVE,0.9947150349617004,NEU,0.8931781649589539,neutral,0.5105398893356323

80,"How Trump just made Gavin Newsom’s day by sending the National Guard to Los Angeles — politically, anyway | On Monday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that he would sue President Donald Trump’s administration for seizing control of the state’s National Guard to quell immigration enforcement protests in Los Angeles.   In response, Trump seconded his “border czar” Tom Homan’s threat that he might arrest the governor. “I would do it if I were Tom,” Trump told reporters. Just the day before, in an interview with NBC News, Newsom had all but dared Homan to arrest him.  The protests began late last week after Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents conducted raids and arrests in Los Angeles at a Home Depot that resulted in 44 people being arrested.  The move gave Newsom, who has never been able to conceal his aspirations for higher office, an incredible surge of media attention just after he received months of public derision. In truth, Trump’s war on Los Angeles has given California’s Democrats, who have long been beleaguered, a new life. While California has long been one of the biggest vote banks for the Democrats, in recent years, it has caused just as much heartburn for the party. During the Covid-19 pandemic, people fled the state given the high cost of living, though it has seen its population grow in the past two years. California also accounted for a quarter of all homeless people in the United States in 2024, according to a report from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Newsom has always had a penchant for the spectacle, going back to his time as mayor of San Francisco, when he performed same-sex marriages when even Democrats like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton publicly opposed marriage for gay couples. He relished debating Ron DeSantis, Florida’s ultra-conservative governor, on Fox News and loves going on the network more than people might expect a Democrat from liberal San Francisco should. But he’s also faced criticism in recent months for how he handled — or failed to get a handle on — the out-of-control wildfires earlier this year. He’s also ruffled some Democratic feathers with his decision to chat with conservatives like former Trump adviser Steve Bannon and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk on his podcast. When he spoke with Kirk, he said that allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports was “deeply unfair,” which naturally angered progressives. But now, Newsom is in the place where he feels most comfortable, in a combative stance pushing back against the Trump administration. Like many other Democratic elected officials, he is weighing whether to jump into the 2028 presidential primary. If somehow Homan decides to slap some handcuffs, it would give Newsom potent fodder for voters in South Carolina and other early-voting primary states. The same can be said for Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. During the wildfires, Bass was actually not in Los Angeles, but rather in Ghana, which violated her campaign promise to Angelenos that she would not travel internationally while mayor. When a reporter grilled her about being absent during the worst fires in the city’s history, she stayed silent. Bass’ approval ratings plummeted in Los Angeles. And like many other cities with large Hispanic populations, Los Angeles shifted to the right in the 2024 election, though it remains firmly Democratic. This would put her in a difficult position going into Los Angeles’s election in 2026, which has a top-two primary system where the two highest-vote earners in the primary advance to the runoff regardless of party. But Bass, in part fueled by Trump’s federalizing the National Guard and sending them to her doorstep, has since pushed back to defend the city she leads. She has urged people to remain peaceful, saying: “We do not want to play into the [Trump] administration’s hands.” If Bass is seen as advocating for her city in a moment when its large immigrant population feels under siege, it could pay large dividends. Then, of course, there is Kamala Harris. In the months since Trump defeated the former vice president by winning the popular vote and all seven swing states, Harris has weighed whether to seek the governorship of the Golden State when Newsom’s term expires or to take another go at running for the presidency. Over the weekend, she denounced Trump’s escalation as “part of the Trump administration’s cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.” Republicans have loved to beat up on California, a state they once dominated with luminaries such as Pete Wilson, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. But if Trump and the GOP overstep their mandate, they risk a backlash and amplifying the very liberal politics and policies that they seek to quell, and might wind up making them stronger in the long run.",POSITIVE,0.9974760413169861,NEU,0.8779026865959167,neutral,0.7603293657302856

85,"The oppressor / oppressed world view | This has become a talking point especially by right wing commentators describing progressives, the left, or academics, such as ""many adhere to a strict worldview where one group is the oppressor and one group is the oppressed."" This is one of Charlie Kirk's comments / criticisms and I've heard Bill Ackman use this language in reference to Harvard. Is this actually a view which is articulated / espoused / promoted / taught by these groups or is this just a somewhat pejorative framing of other ideas? Are there actually college courses titled ""the oppressor and the oppressed"" or some kind of Democrat policy documents that use this concept? I am sure that there are people that think this way and there are definitely people who are all about fighting ""The Man"" and (reasonably) talking about White Privilege. And a lot of the discourse around the Israel / Palestine situation is about which group is oppressing and which is oppressed and what each deserves as a result. But that doesn't make it some kind of unifying theory or driving idea across the entire progressive/left. I personally do not view the world in this way, I acknowledge that there is definitely a concentration of power among certain groups and a disenfranchisement of others. However, for example, I think that everyone should have access to health care whether they be working and able bodied, or retired, or disabled, or unemployed, not because some of these groups are oppressed but just because a wealthy government providing this to its citizens is a great way to provide them with better lives and allow them to recover from catastrophes and stay out of poverty. I also think that anyone of any persuasion should be able to get married and enjoy those benefits, not because they are oppressed but because they are humans and citizens and should be afforded the same benefits as everyone else regardless of their orientation. I think what is really happening is a desire to see complex issues as black and white (on the right) or nuanced (on the left). The right will distill every issue down to simple yes/no talking points, which creates an oversimplification but also creates very effective political messaging. For example, they say that all illegal immigrants are criminals and should be deported, regardless if their crime is overstaying a visa or murder. The left will endlessly debate the different categories of immigrants, where they came from, how long they have been in the US, their status, family situation, circumstances in their home country, etc. and try to come up with a tailored solution for each. I find both approaches impractical. I think the oppressor/oppressed framing is the right promoting a pejorative and oversimplified view of the Democratic ideal of equal rights for everyone including groups that may be disenfranchised. This leads to headlines like, ""The Disfiguring Prism of Oppressor and Oppressed"" and promotes the idea that Democrats / Progressives don't just have differing opinions, but have a deeply intrenched and fundamentally flawed philosophy of the world, which is just another way to widen the divide between the parties.",POSITIVE,0.9962980151176453,NEU,0.9064956307411194,negative,0.49801626801490784

However, after a seemingly never-ending weekend, I realized it was not the constant degradation of women or the villainization of feminism that disturbed me the most, as I had expected. What bothered me more was the sheer number of young girls and women who surrounded me throughout the summit, cheering and rejoicing as Kirk and like-minded female acolytes delivered sermon-like remarks onstage that all zeroed in on one main idea: True femininity resides in servitude and motherhood. I attended Turning Point USA’s Young Women’s Leadership Summit in Grapevine, Texas, a suburb of Dallas, on June 13–15, alongside about 3,000 other attendees, mostly school-aged young women and girls. Predictably, the majority of attendees were white, although there was a notable presence of women of color. Just about every girl was dressed in some rendition of a brightly colored sundress or floral prairie dress, paired with cowboy boots and voluminous hair, a look popularized by an emerging wave of young women in the conservative base. Some wore MAGA merchandise, while others touted “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) tote bags. Arguably, Kirk and his political advocacy organization, Turning Point USA, have played a pivotal role in drawing young women to the ultraconservative right in droves, carving out a niche within the conservative base for a concentrated, traditional definition of femininity focused on marriage, motherhood and an RFK  understanding of health. It would be remiss not to mention the considerable presence that MAHA had at the event. Many speakers advertised their natural supplement lines or their toxin-free makeup and skincare brands. One speaker, a former trauma nurse, professed that the Western medical system is the “enemy of the world.” Prescription drugs were vilified, anti-vaccine rhetoric was celebrated, and science was belittled. The yearning for weight loss or fretting over processed foods are emerging as pipelines for young women to adopt ultraconservative worldviews. Podcasts covering the evils of seed oils and urging women to cook “real foods” are attracting susceptible girls to a new wave of conservatism: MAHA. One of the more popular speakers at the summit, podcaster Alex Clarke, quipped that we should “put women back in the kitchen” because the kitchen is where the “real revolution” starts. Before entering the convention hall, I passed tables encouraging attendees to start their own Turning Point chapters in their high schools or colleges. Next were packed booths selling trendy attire embroidered with “Save Women’s Sports” and posters featuring colorful illustrations of cowboy boots, along with catchy slogans like “Too Cute to Cancel,” alongside others offering anti-abortion propaganda, advertisements for health care sharing ministries and Christian education brochures. When the Young Women’s Leadership Summit kicked off, I quickly realized that, between the summit’s promotion of supplements to cure all health ailments and continuous God-blessings of Donald Trump, it was telling its receptive audience that not only are feminism and Western society lying to them about education, careers and self-sufficiency, but feminism is also concealing the foremost truth about femininity: Women need to be wives and mothers. There was what I can only describe as pure jubilance in the audience as Kirk called upon women to abandon careers and education to “submit to a godly man” and raise “more children than you can afford.” To Kirk, the ultimate goal for every girl should be marriage, and every single decision should push them closer to finding a husband. Without fail, any time a speaker mentioned being a mother or a wife, raucous applause and cheers erupted from the crowd. One speaker, Riley Gaines, best known for railing against transgender athletes, even publicly announced her pregnancy for the first time to a frenzied standing ovation, akin to the reaction of a crowd at a packed concert or sporting event. But Kirk’s messaging went well beyond glorifying marriage and motherhood — it resoundingly discouraged women from entering the workforce or pursuing education. At one point, Kirk professed that, “Husbands should do everything he can to not force his wife into the workforce.” But when he received an earnest question from a woman asking what federal policies he would back to make it possible for single-income households to survive financially, Kirk, predictably, did not have an answer. His solutions are not policy-based, but are instead rooted in indoctrination and unwavering obedience. In one of the two Q&A sessions Kirk led, as teenage girls lined up to ask for his wisdom on navigating school or balancing a career life with motherhood, Kirk stressed that women should not attend college and that high-school girls should prioritize marriage and children above all else. Kirk trumpeted that grades do not matter and that a true patriot should not care about them, suggesting that Christians get bad grades because they do not succumb to the “woke” teachings of the  education system and the Left. If girls do want to attend college, their end goal should not be a degree, but rather a husband, Kirk clarified. At one point, Kirk touted the idea that American society should “bring back” the “Mrs. Degree,” a concept dating back to the mid-19th century, in which women attended college with the intention of finding a husband. Kirk wants the reality for American women to be modeled after the 1950s — and a congregation of over 3,000 women and girls appeared to agree with him. Kirk further urged women not to listen to their professors. Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton claimed that the Left is poisoning kids’ minds through the education system. Speakers continually glorified homeschooling, especially when based in Christianity, and were met with rounds of applause. One speaker, author Heidi St. John, looked out at the crowd and praised: “I see a crowd of homeschool moms.” Countless more examples could be given of the summit demeaning the nation’s education system, and especially a woman’s role in it. (None of the speakers seemed to recognize the irony of Turning Point, the host organization, existing to establish chapters on college and high school campuses.) Speakers warned women and girls that a life filled with degrees and promotions would be empty and miserable. The summit depicted a pathetic and depressed image of the “modern Western woman,” one focused on a career, deprived of children. Feminists were described as hooked on dangerous antidepressants — their lives desolate. Kirk’s brand of traditional femininity and motherhood was juxtaposed as a way to achieve true fulfillment and happiness in an angry and divided society, leaving behind the mental health disorders born from the horrors of feminism. Followers believe the Young Women’s Leadership Summit’s brand of femininity to be the solution to the mental ailments young women face because of feminism, a sentiment I heard from attendees I spoke with. Vulnerable young girls, struggling with self-esteem, eating disorders, anxiety and depression, are turning to the Charlie Kirk world because it markets itself as a way to find happiness amid mental health discontent. Kirk’s wife, Erika Kirk, claimed to “release” girls from the anxieties of feminism, from the idea that they should chase a cozy corner office or a meaningless paycheck. She stressed that all the women in the crowd can, and ultimately should, rely on men, as relying on men is a path to happiness and contentment. For a woman, a career, financial independence or self-sufficiency is only a distraction. Of course, speakers differed in the severity of their messaging, with Kirk outright saying that women should not work, but instead serve their husbands and raise children, while others danced around the idea. All of the female speakers (with Kirk being the only male) had successful careers; there were even multiple female members of Congress who spoke: Reps. Nancy Mace and Beth Van Duyne. Some speakers argued that working could lead to marriage and children, while others said that a career only served as a hindrance to the true contentment that lies in motherhood. Some stressed that women can have both a career and children, just at different times, while others said that a life driven by a job and self-sufficiency would leave them wanting. Still, all of these women were the lead-up to Kirk’s argument that women should only be wives and mothers. Silent obedience, and especially the obedience characterizing the Virgin Mary, was also idolized during the summit, framed as something for every girl in attendance to strive for. Of course, that obedience pertains to following the whims of the men in their lives. Every time this happened, I looked around, horrified, at the children filling the rows and rows of chairs; girls as young as 5 attending with their mothers and grandmothers, young mothers rocking babies in their strollers, and high schoolers hanging on every word. Closing the first night with her husband next to her, Erika Kirk professed: “I get to serve my husband, I get to submit to my husband. He submits to the Lord.” Beyond the blatant dangers of telling young girls and women to obey men, seemingly without question, it was alarming to see just how glorified the idea of a subservient and silent woman was. It was straight out of Kirk’s rigid interpretation of the New Testament: “But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence,” from First Timothy 2:12. Even before attending, I saw that one of the summit’s advertisements depicted an embroidery hoop with its branding. It irked me to see Turning Point utilizing the beautiful art of embroidery, which was once demeaned to “women’s work” and cultivated as a means to teach obedience, domestic servitude and stillness, while also signaling marriage suitability, to promote its anti-feminist convention. It is safe to assume that the Young Women’s Leadership Summit did not use a reference to embroidery to convey any worthwhile message about women creating art and passion in times when women had few options, if any, in both the public and private spheres, or in an attempt to reclaim the art for genuine female empowerment. Instead, the summit wants to promote the image of an obedient, submissive wife and mother patiently waiting with her needlepoint for her husband to come home because that is, above all else, supposedly what women want. And still, with all the glorification of submission and servitude, I did not hear, during the entire three-day convention, a single mention of domestic abuse or the sexual violence that women and girls face, outside of hate-fueled rhetoric about transgender women and illegal immigrants. While Kirk and other speakers described the ideal woman as one subservient to her husband, there was not a single reference to the possible violence that concept invokes. To the teenage girls and the young women in their early 20s, neither Kirk nor any of the female speakers gave even a brief disclaimer on what to do when your husband, boyfriend or any man is physically or sexually violent. The closest reference was when Erika Kirk made one throwaway comment about how female submission is a “beautiful” thing only in a “healthy marriage.” Instead, Kirk went on an almost laughable tirade about how men are in a “far sicker” position in society than women because of things like “toxic masculinity” and men being talked down to. This is from the same man who argued with a female college student about rape statistics in May: “It is so materially insane to think that one in five American women will be raped in their life. … Meaning that they’re lying about being raped, that they’re lying about being sexually assaulted.” Kirk continued, saying, “Like a fraternity guy and a sorority girl, aged 19, hooking up, both five drinks in at 2  and all of a sudden she like removes consent. Yeah, like that’s a murky, middle gray area.” Any woman who is not indoctrinated into the Charlie Kirk world could tell you that the one in five statistic, if anything, is an underestimation. I would venture that even a sizable number of women and high-school-aged girls I shared a convention hall with would disagree with Kirk on this point. Perhaps that is why he did not philosophize about women lying about being victims of sexual violence during the summit. Instead, Kirk predictably stressed the importance of purity and modesty for young women and girls, but in a way that, once again, demeaned women. He framed the Christian value of waiting for sex until marriage as a way to improve the dating pool and to teach men “self-control,” placing the responsibility of teaching male “self-control” on young girls instead of boys. This is not a new concept in our society; it is something deeply ingrained into girlhood through adults dismissing destructive behavior as “boys will be boys” and questioning “What was she wearing?” This, coupled with Kirk’s lies about sexual violence and his desire for subservient women (women who do not “talk down to men,” or better yet, women who do not talk back), highlights the real danger created by giving men like Kirk a platform. Thousands of young women and girls looked on, starstruck, as Kirk espoused these dangerous, demeaning ideas. They cheered him on. They celebrated him. The Young Women’s Leadership Summit can perhaps be boiled down to Kirk’s most shocking quote of the weekend: “Young ladies need to be able to submit to a godly man.” He said that if the girls in the audience felt any internal disagreement with that, they should “just go pray about it.” Clearly, Kirk’s religious doctrine is how he explains and markets his ideas to young, impressionable girls. His warped understanding of Christianity is the basis for everything he stands for. Kirk and other speakers prepped attendees to engage in “spiritual warfare” (a favorite line of those subscribing to the New Apostolic Reformation that seeks complete dominion over society) for control of American culture, boasting that conservative women are going to save womanhood by integrating biblical values into society. This ultraconservative Christian base cannot be ignored. Turning Point USA promotes Christian nationalism and MAGA on high school and college campuses. It wields considerable influence, and it only grows with each passing year. This year marked the 10th anniversary of the Young Women’s Leadership Summit, and many speakers and attendees celebrated having attended ten years ago, now bringing their own children to the event. Speaker Alex Clarke boasted about the alumni-like network that the summit has formed, and here, she was right. Women and girls are recruited into this movement through family, friends, fellow students, podcasts and social media. They learn not to recoil when Kirk calls for a “return to normal,” referring to women “serving.” Even more so, they learn to celebrate female servitude as something to strive for — something that will heal and complete you. Young women and girls deserve better. I left this conference shocked at what I heard, even though I was familiar with Charlie Kirk and felt like I knew what to expect before attending. Going in, I already knew that nothing Charlie Kirk could say would have even the slimmest chance of changing my beliefs on where a “woman’s place” should be. The same cannot be said for the thousands of girls and women who also attended the Young Women’s Leadership Summit. Girls as young as 5 witnessed a weekend-long celebration of female servitude, while the women they look up to cheered it on. The Charlie Kirks of the world, and the women who follow them, cannot be written off as a fringe movement solely comprised of zealots. Turning Point USA has real, tangible power and is shaping the worldview of a new generation. The twisted religious doctrine that Charlie Kirk espouses cannot go unchallenged. Women and girls need to know that there is so much more in the world for them outside of submission. They need to be able to build lives based on their own values and aspirations, separate from those imposed by men masquerading as messiahs. We must be louder, clearer and more persistent than those telling susceptible women and girls that God ordains female submission under men.",NEGATIVE,0.9931219220161438,NEG,0.7624350786209106,negative,0.6398701071739197

141,"Don't give Charlie Kirk your time or attention | I'd like to think that the majority of students here are or would be against Uppercase Gums and everything he stands for. Of course some people will support him, and that's their choice. But anyone who truly believes in being kind, accepting to all, and letting people live life how they want should be staunchly against this little worm. He's a vocal supporter of taking away women's rights to abortion and healthcare, has pushed white supremacist ideology, and puts his platform in support of the Orange Felon currently in charge of the country. If you've ever seen any of his videos or clips you should know that he doesn't want any actual debate. All he does is interrupt, talk over people, switch the topic, or start firing off bad faith arguments to try and get people tongue tied. He doesn't intend to listen to anything anyone has to say, all he wants to do is get clips of ""libs looking stupid"" because that's what his base eats up. Imagine how pathetic you'd have to be, as a 31 year old man, to decide to spend your time skulking around college campuses and yelling at kids fresh out of high school until they give up because you just won't ever shut up. Let's spread the word to just ignore him as much as possible. Don't even give him the time of day. If he happens to approach you, just say you don't agree to be on camera and leave. That said, here's a petition to try and stop him from coming to campus. Who knows if it will do anything or not but it takes two minutes to sign so if you want to show support for it then please do:  EDIT: Since this post seems to have gotten way more attention than I expected, let me clarify a few things. First, I'm not trying to prevent anyone's freedom of speech. I'm not even personally able to prevent Charlie from coming. He's free to say whatever he wants, even if I don't like it. In fact, if you use some reading comprehension, you'll see that I never even said that we need to/should prevent him from coming. Yes, I linked a petition, but I also said you're free to do as you like. I wanted to give people extra info and options. I'm simply just telling people he is coming for an event, and if you're like me and think he's a gross person, then make sure he doesn't get attention. A crowd tends to draw crowds. If someone didn't know what was happening, they may come over to investigate, and then Charlie gets to show off ""look how big the crowd is guys."" Getting the word out is how people will know to stay away. Second, it's not fascist to say you don't like someone and don't want them at your school. That's also freedom of speech. They say that every accusation is a confession with the right, and those of you that were so quick to call me a fascist are just proving the saying true. Third, all of you saying I'm just giving Charlie free promotion: be for real. Those of you pretending like you just found out about the event and are only now going because you read some guy's reddit post are nothing but trolls. Pretty much everyone who wants to go to the event already knows about it. I do not care if Charlie's little followers go to the event. They were all going to go anyway. But for those of us who don't like him, I'm asking us to work together to make sure the crowd is as small as possible. The fact that you guys are getting so angry at the fact that I don't like your social media talking head is showing who the real crybaby snowflakes are. Have a nice day! Maybe go get some fresh air and do your homework.",NEGATIVE,0.999333918094635,NEG,0.8843839168548584,negative,0.6883663535118103
